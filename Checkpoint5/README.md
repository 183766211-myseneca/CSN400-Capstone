You must then add below content into your `README.md`:

## Part A - Creating Resources in Azure Portal
 Take Screenshots of DevTest, DevTestLab Configuration & Policies & Virtual Machines Details. Screenshots should clearly show your Resource Group Name. Add your screenshots in your `README.md` as a proof for completion of Part A - Creating Resources in Azure Portal
## Part B - Working with `az lab` CLI command
 Links to all files you created in this part. Isolate `name` property in `devtest_lab.json` and embed it directly in your `README.md` as a sub-section of a `json` object. You just need to include the key-value pair. 
## Part C - Creating VMs using Azure Resource Manager ARM and Custom Images
 Run a command in CLI that lists all your Custom Images in your DevTest Lab environment. You may refer to instructions in [Part B](#part-b---working-with-az-lab-cli-command) for the command and its usage examples.
## Part D - Azure Cost Analysis Charts
Submit the cost analysis screenshots as per instructions in your README.md. Make sure images are not blur and clearly show your `Student-RG-xxxxxx`. Also make sure each image has a caption to indicate what it captures.
